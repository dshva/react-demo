Designed with FP in mind
Write once, run anywhere vs Learn once, write anywhere
Immutable views/components
Pure render function

JSX
Difference between properties and state

Composition

Stateless components (State.js)
References (CreateTodoForm.js)
Restricting renders (TodoList.js)

Testing components

React chrome tool
